# Post-Work Findings

Living record of post-work review issues — gotchas, accepted limitations, and issues that deserve
attention. NOT a to-do list (deferred work goes to `docs/TODO.md`; bugs go to `docs/OPEN_BUGS.md`).

### Clone-then-update chat handlers: last-write-wins window (TODO #11 refactor, 2026-06-06)

The check chat-card handlers snapshot `system.toObject()` at click time and replace `results`
wholesale, so two rapid clicks on DIFFERENT targets within one update round-trip are
last-write-wins — the second click's payload silently reverts the first (the old live-mutation flow
accumulated same-client clicks instead). Accepted limitation: the window is one update round-trip,
the revert is visually self-evident and recoverable by re-clicking, and the new flow eliminates the
old flow's invalid-state (compounding double-click) and dirty-model-on-rejected-update hazards. If
it ever bites in play, the principled fix is a per-message serial queue around
`document.data.update(...)`.
