### 1. Casting-check roll-time auto-max added the purchase count, not the increment-scaled amount

- **What:** `calculateCastingCheckResults` (`src/check/types/casting-check/CastingCheckResults.js`),
  in the single-affordable-scaling-aspect auto-maximize branch, grew `currentValue` by
  `delta * Math.max(initialValue, 1)` but added only `delta` (the purchase count) to
  `results.damage`/`results.healing`. The chat card's per-step controls
  (`CastingCheckChatMessageScalingAspect.svelte`) move damage/healing by `max(initialValue, 1)` per
  step, so for an `initialValue: 2` damage aspect with 2 extra successes the roll auto-maxed value
  +4 / damage +2, and two card decreases then subtracted 4 — leaving damage 2 below its base.
- **Severity:** Low / narrow. The divergence is reachable only with `initialValue > 1` scaling
  aspects (at `initialValue` 0 or 1 the increment is 1, so `delta × 1 ≡ delta`).
- **Found:** 2026-06-06 by the Task 4 quality review of the chat-mount-keying characterization
  tests (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-chat-mount-keying-and-clone-update.md`).
- **Fixed:** 2026-06-06 on the `chat-mount-keying` branch — damage/healing now add the same
  increment-scaled `increase` as `currentValue`, gated by a TDD unit case
  (`tests/unit/check/type-results.test.js`, "scales auto-maximized damage by the aspect increment,
  not the purchase count").
