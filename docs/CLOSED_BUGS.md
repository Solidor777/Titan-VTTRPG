Previously closed bugs and their history. Open bugs live in `docs/OPEN_BUGS.md`; entries move here
when fixed.

### 1. Casting-check roll-time auto-max added the purchase count, not the increment-scaled amount

- **What:** `calculateCastingCheckResults` (`src/check/types/casting-check/CastingCheckResults.js`),
  in the single-affordable-scaling-aspect auto-maximize branch, grew `currentValue` by
  `delta * Math.max(initialValue, 1)` but added only `delta` (the purchase count) to
  `results.damage`/`results.healing`. The chat card's per-step controls
  (`CastingCheckChatMessageScalingAspect.svelte`) move damage/healing by `max(initialValue, 1)` per
  step, so for an `initialValue: 2` damage aspect with 2 extra successes the roll auto-maxed value
  +4 / damage +2, and two card decreases then subtracted 4 — leaving damage 2 below its base.
- **Severity:** Low / narrow. The divergence is reachable only with `initialValue > 1` scaling
  aspects (at `initialValue` 0 or 1 the increment is 1, so `delta × 1 ≡ delta`).
- **Found:** 2026-06-06 by the Task 4 quality review of the chat-mount-keying characterization
  tests (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-06-chat-mount-keying-and-clone-update.md`).
- **Fixed:** 2026-06-06 on the `chat-mount-keying` branch — damage/healing now add the same
  increment-scaled `increase` as `currentValue`, gated by a TDD unit case
  (`tests/unit/check/type-results.test.js`, "scales auto-maximized damage by the aspect increment,
  not the purchase count").

### 2. `report-cards.spec.js` fast-healing apply-confirm e2e read-race flake (was OPEN_BUGS #4)

- **What:** The apply-confirm e2e (`tests/e2e/report-cards.spec.js`, "clicking apply heals the actor
  and partial-merges fastHealing") flaked once in a 2026-06-05 full-suite run (logged as OPEN_BUGS
  #4, mechanism unknown) and recurred in the 2026-06-06 full-suite verification on the
  `chat-mount-keying` branch (`fastHealing.confirmed` read `false`). Mechanism: the apply handler
  (`ChatMessageApplyFastHealingButton.svelte`) updates the ACTOR first (`applyHealing`) and the
  MESSAGE second (`fastHealing.confirmed: true`); the test polled only the stamina (the first
  update), then single-shot read the message (the second) between the two updates — a read-race
  that loses under full-suite load.
- **Evidence:** The Playwright failure snapshot showed both rendered cards already re-rendered in
  the confirmed state moments after the failed read — the message update landed late, not never.
  The file passed 13/13 in isolation.
- **Found:** 2026-06-05 (original flake, full-suite run); mechanism identified 2026-06-06.
- **Fixed:** 2026-06-06 on the `chat-mount-keying` branch — the test now polls
  `fastHealing.confirmed` via `expect.poll` before asserting `total`. Production code is unchanged
  (the handler's actor-then-message update ordering is legitimate).
