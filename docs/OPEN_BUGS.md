### 92. A world actor, token or pack holding a base-type Active Effect fails to load (TITAN registers only the `effect` and `condition` AE types)

- **What:** `src/hooks/OnceInit.js` sets `CONFIG.ActiveEffect.dataModels` to `{ effect, condition }`, replacing core's
  `{ base: ActiveEffectTypeDataModel }`, so the client cannot construct a base-type Active Effect (`changes is not
  iterable` in core's `_shimChanges`). Measured live: `createEmbeddedDocuments` with a base-type effect creates
  nothing and raises no error; a world actor holding one stops the world from loading (`game.ready` never set, page
  error from `trackCollectionFailures`); a packed actor holding one loads with the effect in `invalidDocumentIds`, and
  deleting that effect throws and leaves it stored.
- **Found:** 2026-09-30 by the Task 5 fix round (plan B), measured live.
- **Status:** Not handled in code by user decision 2026-09-30 (local worlds cleaned one-off).
